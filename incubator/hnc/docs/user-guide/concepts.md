### Why use regular namespaces?

Before delving too deep into _hierarchical_ namespaces, it’s worth considering
why Kubernetes has _any_ concept of namespaces in the first place.

Firstly and most obviously, namespaces are a way to organize your Kubernetes
objects, and prevent you from having to find unique names for every object in
your cluster of a given Kind. While two objects of _different_ Kinds (for
example, a Service and an Endpoint) may share the same name, no two objects of
the same Kind may share the same name within a namespace. This makes it easy for
Kubernetes users to use short names, such as “frontend” or “database”, without
colliding with other objects on the same cluster.

More subtly but just as importantly, namespaces are the principal unit of
security isolation and identity in the Kubernetes control plane. They enforce
_exclusivity_ - that is, every namespaced object may belong to only one
namespace. And they allow _grouping_, as described above. These exclusive groups
make them a natural target for sets of related resources. For example,
namespaces are the default target for various policies such as Role Bindings and
Network Policies, as well as extensions to Kubernetes, such as Istio policies.

Of course, it is possible to apply policies _within_ namespaces, but this is
often poorly supported by Kubernetes itself, can be error-prone, and could be
confusing both to human users as well as tools in the Kubernetes ecosystem. For
example, RBAC policies can target objects with individual names, but such
policies are hard to maintain.

As another example, a Pod in a namespace can run as _any_ Service Account from
the same namespace, even one with privileges that far exceed what the Pod
requires; administrators cannot restrict this without resorting to advanced
techniques such as validating admission controllers or [OPA
Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper). As a result,
applying different policies to different Service Accounts is a weak policy,
unless those Service Accounts are also from different namespaces.

In summary, namespaces are useful constructs for organization, security and
workload identity.

### Why use hierarchical namespaces?

Since namespaces are so useful, you may find yourself creating many namespaces
per cluster. However, just as objects would have been hard to manage without
namespaces, you’ll find that you’ll run into many problems managing all those
namespaces:

* You might want many namespaces to have similar policies applied to them, such
  as to allow access by members of the same team. However, since Role Bindings
  operate at the level of individual namespaces, you will be forced to create
  such Role Bindings in each namespace individually, which can be tedious and
  error-prone. The same applies to other policies such as Network Policies and
  Limit Ranges.
* Similarly, you might want to allow some teams to create namespaces themselves
  as isolation units for their own services. However, namespace creation is a
  privileged cluster-level operation, and you typically want to control this
  privilege very closely.
* Finally, you might want to avoid having to find unique names for every
  namespace in the cluster.

The Hierarchical Namespace Controller addresses the first two of these problems
by allowing you to organize your namespaces into _trees_, and allowing you to
apply policies to those trees (or their subtrees), including the ability to
create new namespaces within those trees.

Unfortunately, HNC cannot solve the requirement that every namespace must be
uniquely named, since this is imposed by Kubernetes itself. However, in practice
this is typically not as stringent a requirement as you might fear. Google’s
internal container management system (Borg) has a concept similar to namespaces,
and tens of thousands of teams regularly use it without any serious conflict.

<a name="why-not-hns"/>

### When _shouldn’t_ I use hierarchical namespaces?

Hierarchies are ideal for expressing ownership and applying default policies but
they are unidimensional - a namespace may only have one parent. However, the
real world is multidimensional; you might want to apply one set of policies to a
namespace based on its ownership, but other (orthogonal) policies based on its
environment (for example,  staging vs. prod) or criticality (for example, batch
vs. realtime).

Unlike hierarchies, labels can be used to implement these kinds of flexible
policies, but they have drawbacks of their own:

* Labels in Kubernetes generally have no permissions; if you have the ability to
  edit an object, you can apply whichever labels you like. This makes them
  unsuitable for policy application unless you trust all the possible editors of
  the relevant objects.
* While labels are more flexible than hierarchies, labels are also much easier
  to get wrong. HNC helps to ensure that most namespaces have a parent and hence
  a healthy set of defaults, while labels can be harder to audit and verify.

If hierarchies do not suit your needs, you can use tools such as the [Namespace
Configuration
Operator](https://github.com/redhat-cop/namespace-configuration-operator) (which
is based on labels) or [Anthos Config
Management](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/config-management) (which supports
both labels and hierarchies). You can also use tools such as [OPA
Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper) to help ensure that
labels are applied properly, or to directly express and apply policies that
cannot be expressed via hierarchies.

## Basic concepts

These concepts are useful for anyone using a cluster with hierarchical
namespaces.

<a name="basic-trees">

### Namespaces, trees, and forests

When using HNC, every namespace may have either zero or one **_parent_**. A
namespace with no parents is known as a **_root_** namespace, while all
namespaces with the same parent are known as the **_children_** of that
namespace. Non-root namespaces may have children of their own; there is no hard
limit to the number of levels of hierarchy. The meaning of the parent-child
relationship is discussed further, but can basically be thought of as one of
_ownership_ - for example, a user with RBAC permissions in a parent will
generally have them in the child as well, since the parent owns the child.

The terms **_ancestor_** and **_descendant_** apply pretty much as you'd expect
(such as the parent of a parent, or the child of a child). All namespaces that
are descendants of a root namespace, along with the root itself, are called a
**_tree_**. The set of all namespaces that descend from _any_ namespace, along
with that namespace, is called a **_subtree_**. Namespaces without children are
called **_leaves_**.

Note that a leaf namespace is technically also a subtree, while a namespace that
is both a root and a leaf is technically also a tree. The set of all trees in
the cluster is known as the **_forest_** of namespaces.

HNC includes validating admission controllers that will stop you from creating
relationship **_cycles_** - for example, two namespaces may not be each others’
parents. HNC maintains an in-memory view of all namespaces in the cluster to
make this feasible.

> _Note: There are some rare corner cases that could result in a cycle being
> formed, despite the presences of the validating admission controllers. For
> example, two different users might make namespaces A and B parents of each
> other at exactly the same time; the admission controller would allow this
> (since neither is yet the parent of the other), leading to a cycle.
> Alternatively, an admin might simply accidentally disable the admission
> controllers. In such cases, HNC will put a critical condition on the
> namespaces until the cycle is resolved._

In the command line, you may set a namespace’s parent using the `kubectl-hns`
plugin as follows: `kubectl hns set <child> --parent <parent>`. You can also
view the subtree rooted at a namespace via the command `kubectl hns tree <ns>`.
More detailed hierarchical information for that namespace is also available via
`kubectl hns describe <ns>`.

<a name="basic-subns">

### Subnamespaces and full namespaces

Any regular namespace in a cluster may have its parent set. That is, you may
create a namespace via `kubectl create namespace foo`, and then set its parent
via `kubectl hns set foo --parent bar`. However, this first step always requires
cluster-level privileges, which may not be widely granted in your cluster.

To solve this, HNC introduces the concept of **_subnamespaces_**, which is a
namespace that is created as a child of another namespace, and whose lifecycle
is bound to that of its parent. Instead of having cluster-level permissions, you
only need some narrow permissions in the parent namespace. Any namespace that
isn’t a subnamespace is referred to as a **_full namespace_**.

Subnamespaces have two significant differences relative to full namespaces:

* Full namespaces can either be root namespaces or children, and can have their
  parents set, changed, or unset at any time. By contrast, subnamespaces are
  created as a child of another namespace, and this parent can never be changed.
* Full namespaces have independent lifecycles. If the parent of a full namespace
  is deleted, this does not delete the child. By contrast, subnamespaces have
  their lifetimes tied to that of their parent: if the parent is deleted, so is
  the subnamespace. HNC includes features to prevent you from accidentally
  delete subnamespaces, or trees of subnamespaces.

In all other respects, subnamespaces and full namespaces are identical. For
example, subnamespaces must have unique names within the cluster. Subnamespaces
can be parents of full namespaces (and vice versa, of course) although this is
probably not a great idea.

You can create a subnamespace from the command line via `kubectl hns create child
-n parent`.

<a name="basic-propagation">

### Policy inheritance and object propagation

Namespaces in HNC **_inherit_** policies from their ancestors. If you are
familiar with object-oriented languages such as C++ or Java, this will seem
quite natural. Similarly, in many companies, you might have policies that apply
to an entire organization, some that apply to only one department and some that
apply only to individual teams; each of these levels inherits all the policies
from the level above it. This is the model that HNC follows.

The primary way that HNC implements this policy inheritance is simply to copy
them. We refer to this process as **_propagation_**. For example, a Role Binding
in parent namespace `team-a` with a name such as `team-members` will be
propagated to all children of `team-a`; that is, all children of `team-a` will
have its own copy of the `team-members` Role Binding. HNC ensures that these
copies will always stay in sync with the original copy, which is known as the
**_source object_**. The copies are known as **_propagated objects_**.

This implies that any child namespaces, such as `service-1`, are not allowed to
have any independent Role Binding of the same name as that of any of its
ancestors; if it does, HNC will overwrite it. We are considering adding the
concept of **_exceptions_** to HNC to allow policies in child namespaces to
override those from parents in limited circumstances; please let us know if this
would be useful to you.

By default, HNC only propagates RBAC Roles and RoleBindings. However, you can
configure HNC to propagate any other Kind of object, including custom resources.
For example, you might want to propagate the following Kinds of builtin objects:

* **Network Policies:** Allows all workloads within a subtree to be restricted
  to the same ingress/egress rules (but [see below](#basic-labels) for other
  ways to use the hierarchy).
* **Limit Ranges:** Prevents any one pod in a subtree from consuming too many
  resources.
* **Resource Quotas:** Prevents any one namespace in a subtree from consuming
  too many resources. However, users with the ability to create subnamespaces
  can effectively work around this limitation by simply creating a new child
  namespace with the same quota, though efforts are underway to restrict this
  behaviour ([see below](#basic-labels)).
* **Secrets:** Allows Secrets, such as credentials, to be shared across multiple
  namespaces. This is useful if credentials owned by a team must be shared
  across different microservices, or different versions of the same
  microservice, each of which is in its own namespace.
* **Config Maps:** Allows Config Maps to be shared across microservice
  namespaces.

When the original object is updated or deleted, all propagated copies are also
updated or deleted as quickly as possible. Similarly, if you change the parent
of a namespace, any objects that no longer exist in the namespace’s ancestry
will be deleted, and any new objects from that ancestry will be added.

Every propagated object in HNC is given the `hnc.x-k8s.io/inheritedFrom` label.
The value of this label indicates the namespace that contains the original
object. The HNC admission controller will prevent you from adding or removing
this label, but if you manage to add it, HNC will likely promptly delete the
object (believing that the source object has been deleted), while if you manage
to delete it, HNC will simply overwrite the object anyway.

<a name="basic-labels"/>

### Tree labels and non-propagated policies

While the hierarchy is _defined_ in the [`HierarchicalConfiguration`](#admin-hc)
object, it is _reflected_ on the namespaces themselves via HNC-managed labels.

For example, let’s say that namespace `service-1` has a parent `team-a` and a
grandparent `division-x`. In this case, the namespace `service-1` will have the
following three labels applied to it:

* `service-1.tree.hnc.x-k8s.io/depth: 0`
* `team-a.tree.hnc.x-k8s.io/depth: 1`
* `division-x.tree.hnc.x-k8s.io/depth: 2`

Due to their suffixes, these are known as **_tree labels_**.

Tree labels can be used in two ways. Firstly, any policy that uses namespace
label selectors may use them directly - even if those policies are not
themselves propagated. For example, not only can you put a Network Policy in
`team-a` that will apply to any namespace in that subtree but you can also
configure that policy to allow traffic from any namespace in that subtree by
using the operator `team-a.tree.hnc.x-k8s.io/depth exists`.

Secondly, other applications can use these namespaces to inspect the current
state of the hierarchy. For example, the multitenancy working group heard a
proposal for a hierarchical resource quota to limit resource usage within a
subtree, not just a single namespace. Such applications could directly use the
`.spec.parent` in the `HierarchyConfiguration`, but labels are typically easier
to work with. For example, HNC will ensure that tree labels never express a
cycle, so any labels that are present are guaranteed to be usable.

Note that _in general_, you cannot always trust the values of labels for policy
purposes, because anyone who can edit a Kubernetes object can also apply
whichever labels they like. However, HNC will overwrite any changes made to
these labels, so other applications can trust these labels for policy
application.

## Administration

These concepts are useful for anyone who needs to administer hierarchical namespaces.

<a name="admin-hc"/>

### Hierarchical Configuration

Until now, we’ve avoided mentioning how the hierarchy is actually represented in
the cluster. The answer is that every namespace may contain a single object with
the Kind `HierarchicalConfiguration` and the name `hierarchy`. This object is
used to configure the subtree rooted at the namespace, and also to report any
problems with the hierarchy. It is also the RBAC attachment point (see
“Namespace administrators,” below).

The parent is defined by the `.spec.parent` field. The `kubectl hns set
--parent` command simply edits this field, but you may also edit it directly in
a yaml file and update it via `kubectl apply -f` (or via `kubectl edit`), if you
have sufficient privileges.

The _status_ of the config is more interesting, as it contains the following
useful properties:

* **Children:** A list of all children of this namespace.
* **Conditions:** A list of all problems affecting this namespace (see more below).

The hierarchical configuration can easily be inspected via the `kubectl hns
describe <ns>` command.

<a name="admin-admin"/>

### Namespaces administrators

Any user (or service account) with the ability to create or update the
hierarchical configuration of a namespace is known as an **_administrator_** of
that namespace from HNC's perspective, even if they have no other permissions
within that namespace. There are two ways you might typically become the
administrator of a namespace:

* You have a Cluster Role Binding that gives you the right to update configs
  across the cluster.
* Someone with that permission has granted you the right to update configs in a
  particular namespace via a Role Binding. Since that Role Binding will be
  propagated to all descendants of that namespace, this typically means you will
  also be an administrator of all descendant namespaces.

Even if you create a root namespace (via `kubectl create namespace foo`), you
are not an administrator of it (from HNC’s perspective) unless you also have
update permissions on the hierarchical config. Conversely, being a namespace
admin does not give you the right to, say, delete that namespace. However, as
with all other Role Bindings, if you are an admin of a namespace, you can grant
that privilege in that namespace or any of its descendants to others.

However, being the admin of a namespace does not give you free reign over that
namespace’s config. For example, if you are the admin of a child namespace but
_not_ its parent, you may not change the parent of your namespace, as this would
remove privileges from the admin of the parent (otherwise known as a
**_superadmin_**, which in HNC's context means an admin of any ancestor
namespace). Similarly, even if your namespace is a root, you may not set its
parent to any namespace of which you are not currently an admin, since the
namespace could then inherit sensitive information such as Secrets.

In general, to change the parent of your namespace N from A to B, you must have
the following privileges:

* You must be the admin of the highest namespace that will _no longer_ be an
  ancestor of namespace N after this change, in order to confirm that you are
  happy to lose your privileges in namespace N.
* You must be the admin of namespace B, in order to acknowledge that sensitive
  objects from B may be copied into namespace N.

A cluster administrator will typically have these privileges, and if A and B are
in the same tree, the admin of their common ancestor will be able to make the
change. However, if no single person exists with these privileges, you could ask
the admin of the root of A to make N a root namespace, then manually grant the
admin of B privileges to N, then ask that admin to make N a child of B.

<a name="admin-conditions">

### Conditions

As mentioned above, a **_condition_** is some kind of problem affecting a
namespace or a propagated object. Conditions are reported as part of the status
of the `HierarchicalConfiguration` object.

Every condition contains a machine-readable string, a human-readable message,
and an optional list of objects that are affected by the condition. For example:

* The `CritCycle` condition is used if you somehow bypass the validating webhook
  and create a cycle.
* The `CannotPropagate` condition indicates that an object in this namespace
  cannot be propagated to other namespaces. This condition is displayed in the
  source namespace.

Any condition that begins with the `Crit` prefix is a **_critical condition_**,
and indicates that there’s a serious problem with the namespace that prevents
normal HNC operation. Namespaces with critical conditions have the following
properties:

* Object propagation is disabled. That is, new objects will not be copied in,
  and obsolete objects will not be removed.
* The hierarchy within the subtree may not be modified, except to resolve the
  condition (eg break a cycle or replace a missing parent).

When the condition is resolved, object propagation resumes.

When the HNC restarts, there can be a short period during which spurious
critical conditions may appear on namespaces as HNC restores its internal view
of the cluster’s hierarchy. These are harmless and generally resolve themselves
within 10-30 seconds for reasonably sized hierarchies.

In all other cases, conditions require human intervention to resolve.
